# Checker Project

## Description
The Checker Project is a simple implementation of the classic Checkers game. It includes a basic version of the game (`checker.py`), a version that supports playing against a bot (`checkers-with-bot.py`), and a visual representation of the game's flow in `checkersflowchart.txt`. The project is designed to be easy to set up and run on any machine with Python installed.

## Features
- **Basic Checkers Game**: Play against another human on the same device using `checker.py`.
- **Checkers with AI**: Play against a simple bot with `checkers-with-bot.py`.
- **Game Flow Visualization**: View the game's logic flow using the flowchart provided in `checkersflowchart.txt`.
- **Checkerboard Visualization**: A visual representation of the checkerboard is included in `checkerboard.png`.
